Generate an algebraic equation, find the roots, count all four boundaries for the roots. Change the coefficient slightly and look at how the roots have changed because of this. Round off all the calculations and see how the roots have changed because of this. Now everything is the same, but we have roots, we restore the coefficients by them.
