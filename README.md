THE TASK

Given
Tabular function on a uniform ordered grid of nodes (number M). The degrees of polynomials are given for comparison.

TASKS.
1. Construct an interpolation polynomial and a polynomial in OLS with constant weights of the same degree (given). The interpolation polynomial is constructed on a uniform grid of nodes, separated from the main one. (the given degrees of the polynomial are chosen so that this can be done by preserving the extreme points of the grid).
Conduct comparisons by the following criteria:
Visual comparison of graphs with the application of points of tabular function.
The number of nodes where the value of one polynomial (for example, interpolation) is closer to the value of the table function.
The maximum absolute error for each polynomial at all nodal values ​​of a given tabular function
The maximum relative error for each polynomial at all nodal values ​​of a given tabular function
The mean absolute error for each polynomial at all nodal values ​​of a given tabular function
The average relative error for each polynomial at all nodal values ​​of a given tabular function

2. From the main grid, select an arbitrary grid (not necessarily uniform) from not more than half the nodes of the main grid (M / 2), so as to obtain an interpolation polynomial having the least absolute (or relative) error in the remaining nodes. Check whether it will be better than any polynomial constructed by least degree of M / 2 MN.
 
3. Construct an approximating polynomial along the least squares of the same degree, choosing the weight coefficients to obtain a better approximation. Compare the learned polynomial with the interpolation polynomial in §2.
