ASSIGNMENT 10 Quadratic and cubic spline

It's given.
Tabular function on a uniform ordered grid of nodes (number M). The degrees of polynomials K = number of nodes-1 are given.

TASKS.
1. Construct a quadratic spline on four uniform grids (including a mesh with all nodes). Conduct comparisons on the following criteria (that is, supplement the existing table with new lines):
Visual comparison of graphs with the application of points of tabular function.
The number of nodes where the value of one polynomial (for example, interpolation) is closer to the value of the table function.
The maximum absolute error for each spline in all nodal values ​​of a given tabular function
The maximum relative error for each spline in all nodal values ​​of a given tabular function
The average absolute error for each spline in all nodal values ​​of a given tabular function
The average relative error for each spline in all nodal values ​​of a given tabular function

2. From the main grid, select an arbitrary grid (not necessarily uniform) from not more than half the nodes of the main grid (M / 2), so as to obtain a quadratic spline having the least absolute (or relative) error in the remaining nodes.

3. Perform step 2 for the cubic spline

4. Compare the resulting meshes for the quadratic and cubic splines.
