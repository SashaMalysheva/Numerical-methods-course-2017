Task 9 Natural cubic spline

It's given.
Tabular function on a uniform ordered grid of nodes (number M). The number of nodes is given = the degree of the polynomial +1.

TASKS.
1. Construct a natural cubic spline on four uniform grids (including a mesh with all nodes). Conduct comparisons on the following criteria (that is, supplement the existing table with new lines):
Visual comparison of graphs with the application of points of tabular function.
The maximum absolute error for each spline in all nodal values ​​of a given tabular function
The maximum relative error for each spline in all nodal values ​​of a given tabular function
The average absolute error for each spline in all nodal values ​​of a given tabular function
The average relative error for each spline in all nodal values ​​of a given tabular function

2. Change the boundary conditions and add new rows to the table
The second derivatives are not zero (approximation)
The first derivatives (approximation)
Conditions of absence of the node
